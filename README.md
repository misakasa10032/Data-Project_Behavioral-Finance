# Data-Project_Behavioral-Finance
The code and result of the data project assigned in the course of behavioral finance, fd 2018.
I examine the reversal effect in Chinese A share market during the period from 2000 to 2015 by applying the methodology raised by Jegadeesh & Titman(1993). The basic thread is to create a momentum portfolio based upon the stocks' performance of the past (J) months and then hold the portfolio for (K) months. If on average the cumulative return of the momentum portfolio is statistically positive, the momentum effect exists. Nonetheless, if the contrary is true, the reversal effect exists. Specifically, the shares are divided into three categories i.e. small/medium/large equally according to the total market value and the reversal effect is examined on the three categories respectively.
The result indicates that Chinese A share market reveals significant reversal effect instead of momentum effect in all the three categories of shares: small/medium/large.
